# SaltyRTC JavaScript Client

This is a [SaltyRTC](https://github.com/saltyrtc/saltyrtc-meta) implementation
for JavaScript (ES5) written in TypeScript 1.8+.

The development is still ongoing, the library is not yet production ready.

Currently at least Firefox 45 and Chromium 49 are required.

## Usage

First, create a keypair:

    let permanentKey = new saltyrtc.KeyStore();

Then, create a SaltyRTC instance:

    let salty = new saltyrtc.SaltyRTC(permanentKey, saltyrtcHost, saltyrtcPort)

Depending on whether you're the initiator or the responder, initialize the SaltyRTC instance:

    let initiator = salty.asInitiator();
    let responder = salty.asResponder(permanentKey.publicKeyBytes, initiator.authTokenBytes);

Now you can connect both sides:

    initiator.connect()
    responder.connect()

You can query the current signaling state:

    >>> console.log(initiator.state)
    server-handshake

And you can register callbacks for certain events:

    initiator.on('connected', () => console.log('Initiator is connected'));
    responder.on('data', (dataMessage) => console.log('New data arrived:', dataMessage.data));

The following events are available:

 - `new-responder(responderId)`: A responder has connected. This event is only dispatched for the initiator.
 - `connected(void)`: Handshake has been completed, we're connected!
 - `handover(void)`: The handover to the data channel is done.
 - `connection-error(ErrorEvent)`: A connection error occured.
 - `connection-closed(CloseEvent)`: The connection was closed.
 - `data(saltyrtc.Data)`: A new data message was received.
 - `data:<data-type>(saltyrtc.Data)`: The data event, filtered by data type.

## Development

Install dependencies with npm (or alternatively install them manually):

    $ npm install

To compile the TypeScript sources to a single minified JavaScript (ES5) file:

    $ npm run dist

The resulting file will be located in `dist/saltyrtc.min.js`.

You can also watch the source code for changes and recompile automatically:

    $ npm run watch

Due to a bug (https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-typescript/issues/43),
rollup does not currently output non-fatal errors from TypeScript. To see
those, simply issue `npm run validate` in your main directory.

    $ npm run validate

## Testing

To compile the test sources, run:

    $ npm run rollup_tests

You can also watch the tests and sources for changes and recompile
automatically:

    $ npm run watch_tests

Then simply open `tests/testsuite.html` in your browser!

Alternatively, run the tests automatically in Firefox and Chrome:

    $ npm test

## Coding Guidelines

- Write clean ES2015
- Favor `const` over `let`
